<p>This page indexes the <a href="http://www.octave.org/">Octave</a>-language
program code used for the experiments in the paper <a href="audio.pdf">"Audio
Restoration"</a> by Joseph Nuzman. Separate listings are provided for code
implementing click removal and hiss reduction. Those unfamiliar with the code
may wish to start by browsing DoFigs_clicks.m, DoSamps_clicks.m,
DoFigs_hiss.m, and DoSamps_hiss.m. These script files were used to generate
all the figures, tables, and audio samples used in the paper (roughly in the
order they appear). In these files, it can be seen which are the highest
level functions, and how they are used.</p>
