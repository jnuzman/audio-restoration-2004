# audio-restoration-2004
Citable (static) location for the 2004 paper "Audio Restoration: An Investigation of Digital Methods for Click Removal and Hiss Reduction"

This repository hosts the above paper and supporting material original hosted as http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/jnuzman/audio/audio.pdf.  The material is no longer available there.

Content hosted here includes:
* [Paper itself](audio.pdf)
* [Audio samples](audio_samples.html)
* [Program code](program_code.html)
* [Tarball containing all the material](audio.tar.gz)

The paper hosted here has been modified from the original version only to update to current web links and email address.

I intend to place the program source files in a separate repository to allow for hosting changes.  I'll update this README when such a repository is available.
